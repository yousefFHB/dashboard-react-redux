## 🔐 Route Logic

| Route                        | Access                              |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `/`                          | Public                              |
| `/about`                     | Public                              |
| `/products`                  | Public                              |
| `/product-details/:id/:name` | Public                              |
| `/auth`                      | Guest only (redirects if logged in) |
| `/profile`                   | Protected (requires token)          |

## 🎬 Page Transitions

All route changes are animated using **Framer Motion** with a reusable `PageWrapper` component and `AnimatePresence` at the router level.

Auth page also includes animated switching between Login and Register forms.

* Violet accent shadows and focus rings
* Glass / blur card surfaces
* Consistent input + button styling
* Sticky navbar with dynamic shadow behavior
